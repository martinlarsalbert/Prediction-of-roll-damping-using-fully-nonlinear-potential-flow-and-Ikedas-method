This data has been collected with manual digitalization from the following paper: 

[1]
Ikeda, Y., 1978. On eddy making component of roll damping force on naked hull. University of Osaka Prefacture, Department of Naval Architecture, Japan, Report No. 00403, Published in: Journal of Society of Naval Architects of Japan, Volume 142.

The data can be used to predict ship eddy damping.

row number: same as in Table 1 [1]
phi_a : roll amplitude [rad]
B_star_hat
omega_hat
model : section model name
B_W+B_F : Obtained value from plots
B_E_star_hat
L_pp : length of section [m]
beam : section beam [m]
T : section draught [m]
Disp : section displacement [m^3]
H0 : half beam to draught ratio 
sigma : section area coefficient 
OG/d : centre of rotation
R : bilge radius [m]
B_E0_HAT : eddy damping
C_r : eddy damping coefficient
a_1 : lewis section coefficient
