Prediction-of-roll-damping-using-fully-nonlinear-potential-flow-and-Ikedas-method
==============================
The repository was used for the work conducted for the paper: "Prediction of roll damping using fully nonlinear potential flow and Ikeda's method". The LaTeX for the actual paper is however [here](https://github.com/martinlarsalbert/inviscid_CFD_-roll_decay)

## Note!
Some of the dependencies and the data used in this repo are unfortunatelly not open source.

# Setup
## .env
place a file called *.env* in the root of this repo containing the environmental variable for the database password. Simply add: password="..."

## nbstripout
Use a pre-commit filter called [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to clean the output from the notebooks, if they contain sensitive information.
