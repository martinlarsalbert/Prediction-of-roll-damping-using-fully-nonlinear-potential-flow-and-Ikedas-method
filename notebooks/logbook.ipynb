The component analysis assumes that the damping is composed of friction damping, eddy damping, lift damping, wave damping, normal-force damping of bilge, keel, hull pressure damping due to bilge keels, and wave damping of bilge keels. Formulas for these components are derived from theoretical and experimental considerations.",
