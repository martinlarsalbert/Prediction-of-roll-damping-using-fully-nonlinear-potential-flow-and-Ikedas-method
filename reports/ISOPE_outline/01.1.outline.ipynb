    "Calculated the roll damping with Ikeda's method for zero speed and 15.5 knots. The damping was [compared](../../notebooks/04.3_KVLCC2_Ikedas_model_tests.ipynb#speeds) with corresponding values obtained from the model tests. The results showed good agreement between the model tests and predictions at speed. The damping predicted with Ikeda's method at zero knots was significantly higher than the corresponding model test. The predicted eddy damping was very large and is most likey overpredicted.  \n",

    "Much effort was made to investigate the eddy damping prediction of the Ikeda's method implementation. It was found, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, that the predicted eddy damping was extremely sensitive to ship sections with almost rectangular shape, where the section area coefficient [sigma](../../notebooks/08.2_ikeda_eddy_sigma.ipynb) was close to one. According to Kawahara the mid section coefficient should not exceed 0.99, which otherwise seem to give a huge extrapolation error according to the [figure](../../notebooks/08.2_ikeda_eddy_sigma.ipynb) above. This was however the case for many of the sections of the KVLCC2, where the limiting value was instead used, to avoid unrealistic extrapolation errors.\n",
